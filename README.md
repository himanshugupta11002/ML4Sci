Common Task 1. Dataset preprocessing 

Description: Use Sympy or Mathematica to generate datasets of functions with their Taylor expansions up the fourth order. Tokenize the dataset.

Common Task 2. Use LSTM model

Please train an LSTM model to learn the Taylor expansion of each function.
You can use a deep learning algorithm of your choice (in Keras/TF or Pytorch).


Specific Task 3: Use Transformer model
Please train a Transformer  model to learn the Taylor expansion of each function.
